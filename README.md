# D3.js: Women Who Code Boston

Exercise from a D3.js Women Who Code Boston meetup on December 5, 2016.

**[Materials](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/general/tree/master/161204_intro-to-d3)**

#### Personal Notes

- D3 is not inherently responsive, but Pym.js is a library that helps. Interchange swaps out the chart at different breakpoints.
- D3 API reference: https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md
- Data Viz Catalogue: http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/
- Upshot by NYT: http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot
- Alternate methods for making charts & data visualization: High Charts (but D3 is more fun & powerful)
